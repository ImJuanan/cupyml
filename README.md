# Cupy for Machine Learning: Overwriting classical machine learning algorithms using CuPy.  
<br>The repo uses [CuPy](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/) only, so please assure that you've installed the correct version of [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) requested before running the code. What have done for now as belows.
## Linear models
1. Linear regression (√)
2. Ridge regression (√)
## Metircs
1. Mean Absolute Error (√)
2. Mean Square Error (√)
3. Mean squared logarithmic error (√)
4. Coefficient of Determination (√)
