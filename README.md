Overwriting classical machine learning algorithms using [CuPy](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/), and the related posts updated synchronously in my [website](https://www.yangxk196.com). Since using CuPy only, ensure that you've installed the correct version of [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) requested before running the code.
